/**
 * # Car Price Comparison with Google Sheets MCP Server Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use HyperAgent with the Composio Googlesheets MCP server
 * to connect to Google Sheets and populate it with car price comparison data scraped from multiple websites.
 *
 * ## What This Example Does
 *
 * The agent performs a multi-step task that requires web browsing and Google Sheets integration:
 * 1. Checks if there is an active connection to Composio Googlesheets MCP server
 * 2. If no connection exists, initiates a connection and waits for the user to authenticate
 * 3. Creates a new spreadsheet titled with the car name and current date
 * 4. Searches for the specified car (Toyota Corolla) on multiple car comparison sites:
 *    - Carvana
 *    - Carmax
 * 5. Collects the 5 cheapest listings from each site including details like price, mileage, model year, and trim
 * 6. Adds the collected data to the spreadsheet in a well-formatted manner
 *
 * ## Prerequisites
 *
 * 1. Node.js environment
 * 2. OpenAI API key set in your .env file (OPENAI_API_KEY)
 * 3. Need to have a Composio account, can sign up at https://app.composio.dev
 *    - Go to this link and get your secure MCP URL (you just need the URL part from the command): https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets
 *    - You will use the url to run the script, for example:
 *    ```
 *    yarn ts-node examples/mcp/google-sheets/car-price-comparison.ts <your-mcp-url>
 *    ```
 *    - When running for the first time, there will be no active connection so you will need to login
 *      with Google OAUTH at the link provided by the agent to authenticate
 *
 * ## MCP Server Configuration
 *
 * This example uses the Composio Googlesheets MCP server which provides tools for:
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_CHECK_ACTIVE_CONNECTION`: Verifies if there's an active connection to Google Sheets
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_INITIATE_CONNECTION`: Starts the authentication process for Google Sheets
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_CREATE_GOOGLE_SHEET1`: Creates a new Google Sheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_SHEET_FROM_JSON`: Converts JSON data to a Google Sheet format
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_BATCH_UPDATE`: Updates multiple cells in a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_GET_SPREADSHEET_INFO`: Retrieves information about a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_LOOKUP_SPREADSHEET_ROW`: Looks up a specific row in a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_BATCH_GET`: Gets values from multiple ranges in a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_GET_SHEET_NAMES`: Gets the names of all sheets in a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_CLEAR_VALUES`: Clears values from a range in a spreadsheet
 * - `GOOGLESHEETS_GET_REQUIRED_PARAMETERS`: Gets required parameters for Google Sheets operations
 *
 * ## Debugging and Monitoring
 *
 * The example includes callback functions to monitor:
 * - Agent output: Raw output from the LLM agent
 * - Step execution: Each step the agent takes during the task
 *
 * ## Running the Example
 *
 * ```
 * yarn ts-node examples/mcp/google-sheets/car-price-comparison.ts <your-mcp-url>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example Output
 *
 * The final output will include confirmation that the agent has successfully created a new Google Sheet
 * and populated it with information about the car prices from different websites.

const TASK_STEPS = `
Your task is to search for a certain car, namely ${CAR_NAME} and compare it's prices across multiple car price comparison sites, namely
- Carvana (https://www.carvana.com/)
- Carmax (https://www.carmax.com)

You will search for the results for the mentioned car on each of these websites, sort the results by lowest to highest, and then add the 5 cheapest results of each website to a google sheet. As much as possible, sort results using the websites own sort, and do not try to sort results by extraction. 

## Google Sheet setup:
1. Run GOOGLESHEETS_CHECK_ACTIVE_CONNECTION to check if there is an active connection.
2. If there is an active connection, go to 4. Otherwise, go to 3.
3. Run GOOGLESHEETS_INITIATE_CONNECTION and output the the auth link to the user, then wait for the connection to be active.
4. Create a new spreadsheet titled "${CAR_NAME} Comparison - {{CURRENT_DATE}}".
5. Get the results from each website, and insert the relevant data (like price, mileage, model year, model name/trim), along with the website source.
6. Add that information to the spreadsheet properly.
Make sure that the data is well formatted and the columns are all there.`;
